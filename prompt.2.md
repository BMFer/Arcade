We want to have an AI assisting agent for the players.

Each assistant will be loaded from a configuration, each assistant will have different personalities, each assistant will be assigned a profile image.

Players will get introduced to the system by selecting their perfered assistant.

This information will be stored in a json datalake.

The AI will be run by Ollama which I have installed already to my pc.
