The application is a game for Discord called Heist.

We will be using Discord.net.

Here is what we need...

Discord Heist Tower

A Progressive Word-Scramble PvP Heist Game

🏗 Core Concept

Each Discord Category = One Escape Room Level
Each Text Channel inside = The Puzzle Room

Players climb upward by:

Solving word scrambles

Avoiding wrong guesses

Using earned power cards strategically

Surviving sabotage from others

The higher the category, the harder the scramble.

🧩 Game Structure
🏢 Category Structure Example
🏚 Level 1 – The Basement
   #room-1

🏢 Level 2 – Storage
   #room-2

🏛 Level 3 – Hallway
   #room-3

🔥 Level 4 – Laboratory
   #room-4

👑 Level 5 – The Crown Room
   #room-5


Each room:

Contains one scrambled word

First correct answer moves up

Wrong answer = drop down one level

📈 Difficulty Scaling
Level 1

4–5 letter common words
Example: LPAEP → APPLE

Level 2

6–7 letters
Example: RTEKMAN → MARKET

Level 3

8–9 letters
Example: LAGHITNMRI → ALGORITHM

Level 4

Themed words (crypto, mythology, tech, etc.)

Level 5+

Double word scrambles

Timed puzzles

Hidden clues in previous channels

You can even add:

Anagrams that have multiple possible answers

Words that require solving a riddle before unscrambling

🎴 Power Card System

Every 3rd level cleared, player earns 1 card.

Cards are stored in:
#inventory-{username} (private channel)

🃏 Example Power Cards
⚡ Knockback

Push any player down one level.

🛡 Shield

Protect yourself from one knockback.

🕵 Spy

Reveal one letter of the current scramble.

⏳ Freeze

Freeze a player for 60 seconds (they cannot answer).

🎲 Chaos

Scramble another player's word again.

🧠 Hint

Get category clue for your current level.

🧨 Risk Mechanic

If player guesses wrong:

Immediate drop down one level

Cannot answer for 10 seconds

If wrong twice:

Drop 2 levels

This prevents brute force guessing.

🏆 Win Condition

Options:

Mode A: Race to the Top

First to clear final level wins the round.

Mode B: King of the Tower

Must hold final level for 60 seconds without being knocked down.

Mode C: Seasonal Ladder

XP system + ranks + cosmetic titles.

🎭 Psychological Layer (this is where it gets good)

Since you’re into strategic systems:

Players will hesitate to attack early.

Power hoarding becomes a meta.

Alliances form.

Betrayals happen near the final room.

This becomes social warfare, not just word puzzles.
